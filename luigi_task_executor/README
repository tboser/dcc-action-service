# Action Service

This guide assumes that you have used git clone to create a dcc-action-service in the ~ directory. If this isn't true, adjust the directory paths in the crontab2.txt file.

These instructions are fairly limited in scope, but it is recommended to test on a box that already has a metadata index. 

If there isn't a luigi server up and running, use the command 'luigid' to start one up, either in a different terminal or in the background of your current screen.

Once the index and luigi server are running, you can either run the command manually (see below) or set up the crontab with the command 'crontab crontab2.txt'.

WARNING: If you are testing on a production box, don't overwrite other crontabs! When this ceases to perplex, this warning will be removved.

(Note: to run SequenceQCTask manually, just copy the command out of crontab2.txt)
